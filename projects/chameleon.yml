    The Chameleon E-Business Framework is a feature-rich framework that offers an extensive range of out-of-the-box e-commerce 
    and content management features. The power of Chamaleon is the ready-to-use B2C and B2B features and the ease of individualisation 
    for complex projects. Originally a content management system for the German media industry, Chameleon started offering e-commerce 
    features in 2005. The focus shifted to complex e-commerce features in the following years. Chamaleon has been Symfony-based 
    since 2013 and was opensourced (MIT License) by Freiburg-based ESONO AG in 2017.
